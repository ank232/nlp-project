<h1> Spam Filtering using Machine Learning
<hr>
<h3> 
Spam, unsolicited commercial electronic messages.
Viewed with widespread disdain, spam nonetheless remains a popular marketing tool because the distribution
cost is virtually free and accountability levels for spamming are typically very low. 
Spammers (those who send spam) went underground and began to hide their identity and location, 
and the content of spam became more nefarious, often advertising pornography or promoting various scams. In addition to offensive content, spam may contain viruses and malicious software (malware) 
that can invade a recipientâ€™s computer, allowing spammers to gain remote access to the computer. 
So, clasifying a message as a spam or normal is the most used tool by very big enterprises.
